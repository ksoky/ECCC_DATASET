# ECCC: Khmer Speech Translation Corpus of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia

This repository is for sharing the dataset of Khmer speech translation corpus for the low-resource speech translation track at Workshop on Asian Translation (WAT) 2022

## Background of ECCC

It is a spoken language translation (SLT) corpus of Khmer to English and French, namely ECCC, which is an international court dataset consisting of text and speech in Khmer, English, and French. However, this provided dataset is only for Khmer SLT, which has the speech in Khmer and translation text into English and French. This dataset has a wide range of speakers: witnesses, defendants, judges, clerks or officers, co-prosecutors, experts, defense counsels, civil parties, and interpreters.
